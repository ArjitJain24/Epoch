# Geographical Analysis of Pincodes in Haryana

## Overview
This project aims to perform geographical analysis of pincodes within the state of Haryana, India. By utilizing k-means clustering, the project seeks to identify spatial clusters based on latitude and longitude data of these pincodes. Insights gained from the clustering analysis will provide valuable information about the spatial distribution, potential economic centers, and regional development patterns across Haryana.
